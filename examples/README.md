# NetGent Examples

This folder contains example scripts and configuration files demonstrating how to use NetGent to automate workflows for real web applications.

## Main Example

- **google.py**: Shows how to configure workflows for searching and interacting with Google, using state prompts.

## Subfolders

- **prompts/**: JSON state prompt files specifying high-level workflow tasks (see `google_prompts.json`).
